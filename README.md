## About

The goal of the this project was to develop a web application to display occupancy and weather information for Dublin Bikes. We aimed to create a web application that was intuitive, responsive and most importantly added new features not seen in the offical dublin bikes site.

Extra features that are included are:

* Bike and bike stand availability predictions
* Find my Location
* Directions to the nearest station with available bike stands
* User accounts
* Historic data analysis

This web app was designed to collect dynamic data from the JCDecaux API about Dublin City Bikes usage on a daily basis. The data collection was processed on an Amazon Web Service instance, EC2, and the data was saved to a RDS MySQL database.
